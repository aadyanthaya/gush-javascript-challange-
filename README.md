# Gust Developer/Designer Challenge - Completed

Thank you for the test. I had a lot of fun working on it.
I've followed the framework's principle and added a `linked-checkbox` component which follows below principle as state in the requirement here https://github.com/gust/javascript-challenge

One clarification. In the requirement it's mentioned
```
When controlling checkbox is unchecked:
  - if the user clicks on a related checkbox, that checkbox becomes checked, and the controlling checkbox remains unchecked.
```
I assume in this case the controlling checkbox needs to be moved to intermediary state. Correct me if my assumption is wrong and I'll update the challenge accordingly.

Thank you for the challenge and I look forward to hearing from you.
